# Airport Beacons
A sample Bluetooth LE beacon system for airports

Option 1: Design a system that uses beacons
## Design a system that uses beacons. Provide a description of your beacon system along with diagrams or sketches of how it works.
By placing beacons around an airport, airlines will be able to keep their passengers entertained and up to date with information as they move about the airport before they board their flight. Airlines can provide up to date flight information, entertainment, or they can provide information about the destination when the passenger reaches their gate, and are in range of the gate beacon. 

## What are the goals of the system? 
The goal of the system is to keep passengers engaged (especially during long layovers), and notified of their flight information and information about their destination. It allows the airline or airport to enhance each passenger’s experience and make it relevant to their trip.

## Who owns the system? 
Either the airport or the airline would own the system, depending on who wanted to advertise themselves, and who wanted to enhance the passenger experience in this way. If airports use it they can also use the beacons to advertise different restaurants and shops within the airport so that people buy more and make more money for the airport. If airlines use it they can keep their passengers up to date on flight information easily, and provide interesting and fun things to do so that passengers enjoy their time while they wait for their flight and have a good impression of the travel experience when using that airline

## Who uses the system? What are the benefits to the beacon users? 
Passengers use the system to stay up to date on flight information, stay entertained during long layovers and be notified about opportunities (sales and things that are happening) around the airport. They benefit because they won’t miss their flight if things change and they will be more educated about the location they are going to. 

## What are the benefits to the beacon owners? 
The benefit to the beacon owner is that the airport can make more money by advertising things that the passengers pass. The airlines that use the beacons benefit because they present a better travel experience to the passengers and will have a better quality service to offer than other airlines that don’t use beacons. The passengers will feel like they are being taken care of throughout the airport. 

## What other elements are involved in the system.
Other elements that may be involved are the websites that are being broadcasted. It is important that the airlines are keeping the airline and flight status information up to date so that if a beacon is linking the passenger to the information, they will be given the right information.

## Implement at least one beacon using nodejs or Arduino. Implement a beacon-client using Electron, iOS, or Android. Concentrate on the design of the system, the beacon implementation is less important, particularly if you're using standard ibeacons.
